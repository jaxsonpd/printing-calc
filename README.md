# PrintingCalc
# Description
A calculator with history that allows function use etc. this project takes inspiration from the speedCrunch app. But plans to extend upon it in the following ways:

- Add ability to delete equations that are unwanted.
- Add tabs so that calculations can have scope.
- Ability to add comments.
- The ability to edit equations.
- The ability to move equations around.

These changes intend to turn the speedcrunch app, which is a pure calculator with functions and history, into more of a mathematical calculation suite that allows the user to have more control over how the maths in described.

# Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jaxsonpd/PrintingCalc.git
